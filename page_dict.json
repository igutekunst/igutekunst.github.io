I'll typically tag these as \"philosophy\".\n\n3) Miscellaneous things I'm learning. I'll tag these as \"did-you-know\".\n\nI will kick off this journey by introducing my first long-term project: Building a \"Personal Cloud\", using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and my best attempt at building something production-ready."

I am building this to servce as the foundation of a \"Personal Cloud.\" This personal cloud is intended as a proof of concept of what a better future internet could look like. \n\n### Introduction\n\nThis project aims to create a comprehensive, real-world microservices architecture, focusing on automation, scalability, and best practices in modern DevOps.\n\nI'll write developer journal entries as blog posts, as well as organize them into a more structured \"how-to\" documentation suitable for recreating the project or following along.\n\nAs of now, I've done some preliminary research and have come up with this plan of action. As I go ahaed and my hands dirty, I imagine some of this plan will change, either slightly or dramatically as I learn from my mistakes and refine my understanding.\n\n\n### Tentative Plan of Action\n\n#### 1. Physical Server Setup\n  - Configure basic networking and access\n  - Implement initial security measures\n\n#### 2. CI Runner Setup:\n   - Install and configure a CI tool (likely [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/))\n   - This CI runner will manage subsequent infrastructure deployments\n\n#### 3. Infrastructure as Code:\n   - Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) for creating standardized VM images\n   - Implement [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for infrastructure provisioning\n   - Setup [Headscale](https://www.headscale.net/) for secure networking\n   - Set up [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) for initial workload orchestration\n\n#### 4. Core Services Deployment:\n   - Deploy [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for secrets management\n   - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/))\n   - Implement logging solution (e.g., [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack))\n\n#### 5. Advanced Orchestration:\n   - Create a separate Nomad cluster for application workloads\n   - Potentially set up [K3s](https://k3s.io/) (lightweight Kubernetes) within Nomad\n\n#### 6. Network and Security:\n   - Implement ingress controllers and load balancers\n   - Set up network policies and firewalls\n\n#### 7. Automation and Scalability:\n   - Develop scripts and workflows for rapid cluster creation\n   - Implement auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nWhy am I doing this? I'd like to learn these tools, and build something useful for myself and others. I have a large project in mind, and I will discuss it after I build the initial proof of concept \"personal cloud\".\n\nPut into dry bullet points, I'd like to:\n\n- Gain hands-on experience with modern DevOps tools and practices\n- Understand whether microservices architecture is a good fit for my project\n- Develop skills in automation, security, and scalability in distributed systems\n- Build something useful for myself and others\n\n### Sharing Knowledge\n\nThroughout this project, I will:\n\n  - Document each step in this developer journal or blog\n  - Create some guides and tutorials\n  - Share challenges faced and solutions implemented. I'd like to specificlaly share my perspective, from someone new to \n    modern DevOps, though no stranger to software engineering.\n  - Possibly create video content"
