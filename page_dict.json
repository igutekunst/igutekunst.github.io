        "content": "# Project Overview\n\nWelcome to my website and blog. Join me as I share my exploration of reality through the lens of language, and primarily machine-readable language.\n\nRead more about me [here](/about). [[about]]\n\n```Python\ndef hello_world():\n    print(\"Hello, World!\")\n```   \n\nI will group my writing into three or more primary categories:\n\n1) My journey working on long-term projects. Posts in this category will be highly technical, and involve topics like computer programming, distributed systems, databases, networking, protocols and more.\n\n2) General musings on the \"Nature of Reality\". I'll typically tag these as \"philosophy\".\n\n3) Miscellaneous things I'm learning. I'll tag these as \"did-you-know\".\n\nI will kick off this journey by introducing my first long-term project: Building a \"Personal Cloud\", using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools and my best attempt at building something production-ready.\n\nThis personal cloud is intended as a proof of concept of what a better future internet could look like. I'll eventually try to explain what I mean by a \"better future internet\", but for now, join me if you'd like to watch me struggle, grow, and hopefully build something useful for myself and others.\n\nThis project aims to create a comprehensive, real-world microservices architecture, focusing on automation, scalability, and best practices in modern DevOps.\n\n### Technical Goals\n\n#### 1. Physical Server Setup\n  - Configure basic networking and access\n  - Implement initial security measures\n\n#### 2. CI Runner Setup:\n   - Install and configure a CI tool (likely [Drone CI](https://www.drone.io/))\n   - This CI runner will manage subsequent infrastructure deployments\n\n#### 3. Infrastructure as Code:\n   - Use [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) for creating standardized VM images\n   - Implement [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) for infrastructure provisioning\n   - Setup [Headscale](https://www.headscale.net/) for secure networking\n   - Set up [Nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/) for initial workload orchestration\n\n#### 4. Core Services Deployment:\n   - Deploy [Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) for secrets management\n   - Set up monitoring tools (e.g., [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), [Grafana](https://grafana.com/))\n   - Implement logging solution (e.g., [ELK Stack](https://www.elastic.co/elastic-stack))\n\n#### 5. Advanced Orchestration:\n   - Create a separate Nomad cluster for application workloads\n   - Potentially set up [K3s](https://k3s.io/) (lightweight Kubernetes) within Nomad\n\n#### 6. Network and Security:\n   - Implement ingress controllers and load balancers\n   - Set up network policies and firewalls\n\n#### 7. Automation and Scalability:\n   - Develop scripts and workflows for rapid cluster creation\n   - Implement auto-scaling and self-healing capabilities\n\n### Learning Objectives\n\nWhy am I doing this? I'd like to learn these tools, and build something useful for myself and others. I have a large project in mind, and I will discuss it after I build the initial proof of concept \"personal cloud\".\n\nPut into dry bullet points, I'd like to:\n\n- Gain hands-on experience with modern DevOps tools and practices\n- Understand whether microservices architecture is a good fit for my project\n- Develop skills in automation, security, and scalability in distributed systems\n- Build something useful for myself and others\n\n### Sharing Knowledge\n\nThroughout this project, I will:\n\n  - Document each step in this developer journal or blog\n  - Create some guides and tutorials\n  - Share challenges faced and solutions implemented. I'd like to specificlaly share my perspective, from someone new to \n    modern DevOps, though no stranger to software engineering.\n  - Possibly create video content"
